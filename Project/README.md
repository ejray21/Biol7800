This repository is to document my final project for BIOL 7800. This report focuses on the sensory and neural mechanisms of parent-offspring recognition in a mouthbrooding cichlid fish. All code for analysis, graph and table making, and manuscript writing can be found in this repository.

This repository has the following file folders:

Data: this folder is used to hold raw data and output data.
R: this folder holds all R codes.
Figs: holds figures generated from R codes.
Doc: this folder holds manuscripts.

Some prerequires:

GNU Make: to document file dependencies and automate workflow. In terminal, you can just type make to render the rmarkdown file to pdf and html.
R: for data clean and analyses.
LaTeX: for fine control of typesetting and pdf generation. Recommend to use tinytex.
Pandoc: for file types converting, e.g. convert markdown file to pdf or docx files or html files.
if you have Rstudio installed, you can also use pandoc shipped with Rstudio
