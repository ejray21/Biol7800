My name is Emily Ray, I am from Cincinnati, OH. I got my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience and Marine Biology from the University of New Hampshire. Now I am a second year phD student in Karen Maruska's lab. I study maternal care and infanticide in a cichlid fish - basically I am trying to figure out how the brain tells a mother to either take care of or eat her babies. Outside of school, I like to read, run, and bike.
